# MatlabBasicExample-1
Basic set of some examples written on matlab.

Created by Alaoefyn

Example 1: 
A MATLAB program that calculates the following (Given as Example1Calcs.png)  Z function for the X and Y values entered with the input command from the keyboard and prints it to the screen with the fprintf command.

Example 2:
An e-commerce site that sells laptops sells laptops for 10000 TL in orders up to 100 (including 100). (TL:Turkish Lira)
On the other hand, this site is original for every laptop over 100.
10% discount is applied over the sales price, and 15% discount is applied for each laptop in orders containing more than 200 (including 200) laptop sales.
The company has a total of 500 laptops in stock.
(Users who make more than 500 requests should be warned with a suitable message and sales should not be made.) Accordingly, the amount to be invoiced to the customer for the relevant sale according to the number of laptops entered with the input command from the keyboard.Write a MATLAB program that finds it and prints it with the disp command.(User with more than 500 requestsshould be warned with a message and sales should not be made.)

Example 3:
Write a MATLAB program that finds the absolute value of the difference and the absolute value of the parts of the 6 numbers entered with the input command from the keyboard and prints them to the screen with the fprintf command.

Example 4:
Write a MATLAB program that calculates the k2 score of the numbers ùíôùüè, ùíôùüê and ùíôùüë that the user receives via the keyboard with the input command using the "Example4formula.png" formula and prints it to the screen with the disp command.


Example 5:

A bank requires customers to have a minimum salary of 6000 TL.

It accepts applications from customers with less salary if they work in the public sector.

Write a computer program that will provide the user's salary in TL and whether he is a public employee via the keyboard with the input command, and print the screen with the fprintf command whether the loan application is accepted or not. (Information whether the user is a public servant should be obtained by entering the relevant character of e or h characters. e character represents yes, h character represents no.)

a) Develop an algorithm to solve this problem and draw the relevant flowchart. The flow chart will be drawn using a computer. (Its given as:)

b) Write the MATLAB program corresponding to the algorithm you developed in part a.

c) Salary information will be a numerical value and public employee information will be a character.
